GDPR compliance for software teams. We match what you declare against what your code actually does.

---

Most companies treat GDPR as a checklist: cookie banner ✓, privacy policy ✓, done. But compliance isn't about documents–it's about whether your code and data actually match what you've declared.

Diff connects to your repositories and data endpoints to build a real-time map of personal data flows, then compares it against your stated purposes. When there's a mismatch, you'll know.
